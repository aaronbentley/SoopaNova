                <PageSectionDescription>
                    Way back in April 2009, it was coming up to my brother, Jims
                    birthday.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    He&apos;s a total petrol-head and was really into Forza
                    Motorsport 3 at the time. Jim had been taking loads of
                    screenshots of his cars and online victories.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I thought it would be a great idea to get one of his
                    screenshots printed onto a framed print for his birthday.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I secretly grabbed the screenshot file and ordered a print
                    of his favourite car (a McLaren F1 in papaya orange) from a
                    local print shop, then took the print to another company to
                    get it framed.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    Jims birthday came around, and I handed over his gift.

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    This got me thinking, there must be others out there who
                    would love to get their favourite screenshots printed,
                    without the effort of having to find a print shop and a
                    frame shop.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I noodled on this idea for a while, but never really threw
                    myself into it.
                </PageSectionDescription>
                <PageSectionDescription>
                    After all, the image resolution of screenshots at the time
                    were pretty low, and I didn&apos;t think that would
                    translate well into prints.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I felt, to quote Howard Stark,{' '}

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    Fast forward to 2022, and look how far we&apos;ve come. 4K
                    gaming is the norm, and the image resolution of screenshot
                    images are pretty damn good.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I thought to myself,{' '}
                    <Typography variant='strong'>
                        &quot;the time is right - I&apos;ve got to do this&quot;

                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    I&apos;ve always wanted to start my own business, and I
                    thought this would be a great opportunity to do so.
                </PageSectionDescription>

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    Plus I now had 20+ years of experience in software and web
                    development, so I had the skills to build the app and
                    supporting systems to make it all work.

                <PageSectionDescription>
                    So I got to work - coding away in the dark hours, working
                    around a full time job and fulfilling my dad duties.

                    It took a little while, but I got there.
